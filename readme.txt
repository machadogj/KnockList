KnockList
Knock List is intended as a knockout.js sample application for managing tasks. It uses HTML 5 local storage to save the tasks, so it can be used as a standalone application (meaning you can close your browser and not loose your tasks).

For a hosted version, you can go to http://machadogj.com/demos/knocklist.html. You don't need to host it to use it though. You can download the source, and execute the page locally.

If you are thinking about learning knockout.js, then download the code and contribute!
